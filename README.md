# Money Stand

Money Stand is a flutter app that allows small businesses to use contactless payment services to their customers.

The app works like this: The cashier enters the customer's orders and generates a uniqie QR code. The customer then scans it using their phone's camera, ie without any additional applications, and it leads to Money Stand's unique url website, where they then see their receipt, and enter their payment information. The payment information is processed through Stripe's API and payment complete!
